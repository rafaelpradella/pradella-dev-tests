# Advanced SVG Animation Course

## Platonic Shapes

* Default shapes in SVG: rect, circle, ellipse, polygon, line;
* `circle` cx/cy: center points;
* You can use your viewbox to crop or use it as a "camera" in After Effects;


## Paths and Groups

* `preserveAspectRatio` controls the shapes positioning inside viewbox;
* It takes three parameters: x (min, mid, max), y (min, mid, max) and meetOrSlice, `xMidyMid meet = align the mid of the element viewBox with the mid of the viewport`
* Slice scale the element as much as possible, and the viewport slices the remaining (very much like overflow: hidden, i think??)
* Using `none` deform the viewBox to meet the viewport;
* Polyline: useful for data visualization, basically an array of points
* Path: has a attribute `d` that contains a series of numbers and letters for path positioning. Uppercase means position absolute, lowercase means relative;
    * M, m => moveTo, path start;
    * L, l => lineTo, diagonal lines,
    * H, l => horizontal line;
    * V, v => vertical lines;
    * Z, z => end of the path;
* Curve commands, describe beziÃ©r curves: Ss, Qq, Tt, Aa;
* Neat CodePen tool for learn those path modificators => [CodePen link]("https://codepen.io/anthonydugois/pen/mewdyZ")


## Optimization + SVG DOM

* If jot inline, SVG only can be animated inside SVG file markup using `<style>`, `<script>` or `SMIL` (IE/EdgeHTML support nonexistent);
