# TypeScript Alura

## What is TypeScript
TypeScript is a superset for ECMAScript, supporting all it´s funcionalities and including more resources like: types, decorators;
Its files (.ts) should be compiled on build time to .js files to work properly on browsers.

Standalone compilation command: `tsc`;
Watch command: `tsc -w`;

## Features
    * Better warning system on your IDE. Even preventing compilation with any syntax error (using noEmitOnError option);
    * `private` declaration for prevent access outside Class/function scope;
    * Capable to use typings to avoid common mistakes on runtime (Number, String, Element);
    * It can be adopted incrementally, everything is typed as default even if you don´t modify anything (implicit type any);
