# Kent C. Dodds - Testing Javascript


## Fundamentals

* Being oversimplistic, a testing library provides a lot of methods to test the relation between actual and expected value of a function, trying to throw the most helpful error message possible;

* Some methods: `toBe`(same value), `toBeGreatedThan`, `toBeLessThan`;


## Mocking

* Mocking role is removing external requests, emulating itÂ´s responses. E.g: Mocking a credit card endpoint for preventing the wait and being charged every test;

* Jest uses `jest.mock() for this`;
